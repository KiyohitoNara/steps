# Commit Message Guidelines
We use short, clear commit messages written in English.  
Each message should describe what the commit changes in a single line.

## Format
```
Short summary of the change (max 50 characters)
```

## Rules
- Use the **imperative mood**  
  Examples: `Fix login bug`, `Update settings page`, `Remove debug logs`

- **Do not include type prefixes** like `feat:` or `fix:`

- Keep the summary **under 50 characters**

- **Do not end the line with punctuation** (e.g., no period `.`)

- **Do not write a body** â€” one-line messages only

- **Keep commits focused** on a single change

## Examples
```
Add password validation
```

```
Refactor header layout
```

```
Remove unused CSS classes
```

Consistent, one-line commit messages make the history clean and easy to understand.
